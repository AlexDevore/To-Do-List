# To-Do List Application

Welcome to the To-Do List Application repository! This simple command-line application allows users to manage their tasks by adding, displaying, removing, and clearing tasks.

## What This Project Does

This To-Do List Application is designed to provide a straightforward interface for managing tasks. Users can interact with the application to add new tasks, display the current list of tasks, remove specific tasks, clear all tasks, and exit the program. The application persists the tasks by saving them to a text file, "To-Do List.txt".
